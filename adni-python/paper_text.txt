Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a long prodromal phase. Predicting AD
progression will clinically help improve diagnosis and empower sufferers in taking proactive care. However,
most existing methods only target individuals with a fixed number of historical visits, and only predict the
cognitive scores once at a fixed time horizon in the future, which cannot meet practical requirements. In
this study, we consider a flexible yet more challenging scenario in which individuals may suffer from the
(arbitrary) modality-missing issue, as well as the number of individuals’ historical visits and the length of
target score trajectories being not prespecified. To address this problem, a multi-modal sequence learning
framework, highlighted by deep latent representation collaborated sequence learning strategy, is proposed
to flexibly handle the incomplete variable-length longitudinal multi-modal data. Specifically, the proposed
framework first employs a deep multi-modality fusion module that automatically captures complementary
information for each individual with incomplete multi-modality data. A comprehensive representation is thus
learned and fed into a sequence learning module to model AD progression. In addition, both the multi-modality
fusion module and sequence learning module are collaboratively trained to further promote the performance of
AD progression prediction. Experimental results on Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
validate the superiority of our method.
1. Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive neu-
rodegenerative disease that gradually impairs patients’ memory and
other cognitive functions. Currently, AD affects over 55 million people
all over the world, and the number is predicted to reach 78 million
by 2030 ( Gauthier et al. , 2021 ). AD not only causes patients endless
psychological and emotional burdens but also imposes a substantial
financial burden on the whole health care system ( Association , 2019 ).
Unfortunately, AD can only be controlled but not cured, which typically
progresses slowly and lasts over a long period ( Wang et al. , 2014 ).
Therefore, it is of practical significance to develop accurate disease
progression models for early AD detection during the presymptomatic
phases, so as to carry out timely therapeutic intervention and avoid
disease deterioration ( Marinescu et al. , 2019 ).
To date, a definitive AD diagnosis can only be made by an analysis
of brain tissues during a biopsy or autopsy, which may cause severe
brain injury and is not applicable for early detection. Consequently,

sion. For example, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) measures
cognitive impairment and is associated with progressive deterioration
of functional ability ( Folstein et al. , 1975 ; Petrella et al. , 2003 ). AD
Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) measures the severity
of the most critical symptoms of AD, and it is the gold standard in
AD drug trials for cognitive function assessment ( Rosen et al. , 1984 ).
Besides, both Clinical Dementia Rating-Global (CDR-Global) and Clini-
cal Dementia Rating-Sum Of Boxes (CDR-SOB) are used to evaluate the
cognitive and functional impairment of AD ( Yang et al. , 2019 ). These
cognitive scores serve as critical criteria for diagnosing AD.
There have been extensive studies on the disease progression model-
ing (DPM) problem. However, most previous methods utilize statistical
models to process medical data, such as regression models ( McDonnell
et al. , 2012 ) and risk prediction models ( Green et al. , 2011 ). In recent
years, due to the rapid development of machine learning, people at-
tempt to employ machine learning techniques for DPM. Compared with

traditional statistical methods, machine learning models do not require
too many assumptions. The mainstream machine learning methods for
DPM fall into three categories: time-series methods, multi-task learning
methods, and deep learning methods.
Time-series methods (Brookmeyer and Abdalla, 2018; Sukkar et al.,
2012) assume that disease progression is driven by clinical manifes-
tations at different time points, for which the temporal correlation
at different time points is introduced in the data modeling, and the
longitudinal trajectories are parameterized into linear or sigmoidal
curves (Ito et al., 2010; Samtani et al., 2012; Sabuncu et al., 2014; Ve-
muri et al., 2009). However, these approaches require prior knowledge
on score trajectories. Furthermore, due to the heterogeneity of AD that
the pathological characteristic are different for each individual (Rahimi
and Kovacs, 2014), the individual progression trajectory may deviate
from the assumed parametric form.
Instead of assuming score trajectories to follow a specific function
form, multi-task learning models regard the DPM as a multi-task learn-
ing problem (i.e. considering each time point as a prediction task)
and consider the correlations between different tasks by employing
regularization terms such as temporal smooth constraint and low-rank
constraint (Nie et al., 2017; Thung et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2013;
Zhu et al., 2017). However, the length of historical visits and target
score trajectories are fixed in most multi-task learning studies (Wang
et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2016), which cannot satisfy the practical
requirement. Traditional multi-task learning methods cannot handle
individuals that do not meet the requirement for the length of historical
visits, which further exacerbates data scarcity because individual data
is quite limited in practical longitudinal AD studies. Therefore, it is
urgent to develop a flexible framework that does not restrict the length
of historical input and the length of target score trajectories.
More recently, people have witnessed the potentiality of deep learn-
ing methods to be powerfully expressive in capturing the intrinsic
data patterns. One of the most competitive deep learning models in
DPM is the recurrent neural network (RNN), which captures long-term
temporal dependencies with its ability to memorize historical informa-
tion in longitudinal data (Marinescu et al., 2019). Compared with the
other two paradigms (i.e. time-series methods and multi-task learning
methods), RNN-based methods require neither the prior knowledge of
score trajectories nor sophisticated regularization terms (El-Sappagh
et al., 2020; Mehdipour-Ghazi et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2020).
Moreover, the characteristic of the recurrent unit in RNN makes it
feasible to process variable-length data and predict the cognitive scores
over an arbitrarily long period of time. We therefore propose an RNN-
based DPM method to meet the flexibility requirements of the length
of historical visits and target trajectories in practical applications.
In addition to the variable length problem for longitudinal data, ef-
fectively excavating the correlations among different modalities should
also be carefully considered. AD clinical data usually comprise mul-
tiple heterogeneous yet complementary modalities, such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
demographics. Most existing studies investigated DPM problem with
single modality (Zhou et al., 2013), while the complementary infor-
mation across multiple modalities is not excavated. Compared with
single-modality methods, combining multiple modalities can syntheti-
cally characterize AD individuals and yield more comprehensive insight
into AD progression. To be specific, MRI and PET measure nerve cell
injuries and the individual’s beta-amyloid level, respectively. While the
demographic data (e.g., site, gender, age, education level, ApoE4 gene,
etc.) can also help to diagnose AD. The ApoE4 gene is known as the
most risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (Kanekiyo and Bu, 2016; Spasov
et al., 2019), and age, education level as well as other biomarkers are
also verified as critical influencing factors of AD (Fleet et al., 2016; Kim
et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2010). Hence, the combination of multi-
modal data augments the prospects for a more accurate prediction.
Moreover, these modalities are often complementary since they depict
the same individuals from different aspects, whereas most existingworks merely concatenate the multi-modal data on each historical
visit (Nguyen et al., 2018, 2020; Thung et al., 2018) and do not take the
complementary information into account, which leads to sub-optimal
results.
Last but not least, some DPM models are developed based on the
assumption of ‘‘data completeness’’, whereas in practical situations,
missing data is a prevalent and severe problem which always exists
in both imaging records and clinical scores. For example, the elderly
patients may not show up at pre-agreed time points or even drop
out from the study (Tabarestani et al., 2020), which is referred as
‘‘visit missing’’ where no brain imaging data (e.g., MRI and PET) are
recorded. Besides, due to the high cost of the clinical examination, some
individuals only have partial records on some visits (Liu et al., 2021).
Likewise, we refer to this issue as ‘‘partial modality missing’’ where
only one imaging modality is available. In addition, the clinical scores
for many patients are missing at some time points. Directly dropping
these individuals will inevitably result in information loss. To address
this issue, most conventional methods consider handling missing data
and modeling progression as two separate steps, addressing the missing
issue before the training process (Stekhoven and Bühlmann, 2012;
White et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2013). In the ‘‘preprocessing’’ step,
they first impute the missing data with mean or other statistical values
based on the observed visits. Then they predict cognitive scores based
on imputed data in the ‘‘prediction’’ step. The performance of this
separate approach heavily depends on the imputation strategy that is
irrelevant to the prediction task. Recently, some integrative approaches
are proposed to address the missing issue during the training pro-
cess (Mehdipour-Ghazi et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2018, 2020). Among
them, the indicator matrix is one of the most commonly used strategies
to indicate the missing data and alleviate the effect of these incomplete
values in the training process (Zhou et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2021).
Instead of filtering out missing values with the indicator matrix, some
imputation-based methods are proposed to further predict and impute
the missing values on the current visit based on the previous visit (Jung
et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2020).
To address the above challenges, we devise a unified framework
that is (1) flexible enough to handle variable-length historical data
and predict arbitrary-length score trajectories, (2) able to effectively
exploit the intrinsic correlation between multiple modalities, and (3)
capable of processing and imputing arbitrary-missing data. Specifically,
we propose a deep latent representation collaborated sequence learning
framework that integrates a deep multi-modality fusion module and
an RNN-based sequence learning module for AD progression model-
ing. We first devise a multi-modality fusion module to exploit the
underlying complementary information from different modalities and
learn modality-shared latent representations at each historical visit.
All individuals and modalities can be jointly exploited regardless of
incomplete modality data, which provides the framework with flex-
ibility to handle ‘‘partial-modality-missing’’ and ‘‘visit-missing’’ data.
We assume that multiple modalities originate from the common latent
representation, which essentially describes the data and reveals the
underlying latent structure shared by different modalities. Thus, the
observations of different modalities can be reconstructed through their
respective degradation network with shared latent representations in
the multi-modality fusion module. Based on the learned longitudinal
representations, we utilize the RNN-based sequence learning module
to flexibly process variable-length longitudinal data and model AD pro-
gression by predicting future cognitive score trajectories. Furthermore,
the ‘‘Model Filling’’ strategy based on RNN is employed to handle
the ‘‘visit-missing’’ issue, which predicts and imputes the missing data
of the current visit based on the estimated values from the previous
visit. We integrate the multi-modality fusion module and the sequence
learning module into a unified framework for collaborative training to
learn task-oriented representations and optimal network parameters.

•The AD progression is investigated from the perspective of incom-
plete and variable-length longitudinal multi-modal data. This is
quite different from existing works that only focus on complete
or fixed-length data. We consider a flexible yet more challeng-
ing scenario in which individuals may suffer from (arbitrary)
modality-missing issue, as well as the number of individual’s
historical visits and the length of target score trajectories being
not prespecified.
•To address the above problem, we first design a deep multi-
modality fusion module to handle the challenge of individu-
als with possible (arbitrary) modality-missing patterns in prac-
tical scenarios. The proposed module can automatically capture
complementary information from incomplete multiple modali-
ties, and thus obtain a common comprehensive representation to
characterize individuals.
•Based on the designed multi-modality fusion module, we fur-
ther propose a deep latent representation collaborated sequence
learning framework to model AD progression of individuals with
incomplete variable-length longitudinal multi-modal data. The
proposed framework can predict the progression of AD measured
by cognitive scores at each time point (indefinitely) in the future
for individuals with even arbitrary modality-missing patterns.
2. Materials
2.1. Subjects
Data utilized in this paper are obtained from the ADNI dataset1
(Jack Jr. et al., 2008), the goal of which is to explore whether the
combination of longitudinal MRI, PET, and other biological biomarkers
can be used to measure the progression of Cognitively Normal (CN)
controls, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and early AD.
Our research is based on three modality data (i.e., MRI, PET, and
demographics) and four cognitive scores (i.e., MMSE, ADAS-Cog, CDR-
Global, and CDR-SOB) of 805 individuals from the ADNI dataset.
More specifically, original MRI and PET are imaging data that will be
respectively extracted as 93-dimension feature vectors, demographics
consist of five demographic features (i.e., site, age, gender, education,
and ApoE-𝜖4). The demographics only contain single time point data,
while the other three data sources (i.e., MRI, PET, and cognitive scores)
are longitudinal data from multiple time points.
1The dataset is available in http://www.adni-info.org.Based on the description of the original dataset, the date when the
individual takes the first examination is called ‘‘baseline’’, and follow-
up visits are named by the duration from the baseline time point. For
example, M06 denotes the visit when the individual was examined six
months after the first visit. In this paper, we utilize 805 individuals with
multi-modal data from six visits (i.e., baseline, M06, M12, M18, M24,
and M36) and clinical scores recorded at 11 visits (i.e., baseline, M06,
M12, M18, M24, M36, M48, M60, M72, M84, and M96), including
186 AD individuals, 393 MCI individuals, and 226 CN individuals.
The summary of demographic information of all these individuals is
outlined in Table 1.
Each individual has complete baseline demographic information,
yet there are missing modalities at some visits in longitudinal data.
Table 2 shows the number of observed individuals for MRI, PET,
demographics, and four cognitive scores at different time points. It
can be seen that each individual has complete MRI, demographic, and
score data at baseline. However, the number of observed individuals
decreases over time due to many practical reasons such as the death of
the individuals or dropout individuals.
2.2. Image processing
We first download 1.5T MR images from the ADNI website and
follow the work in Zhou et al. (2019) to process the original data
and extract Region Of Interest (ROI) based features. Specifically, these
images are processed with the following steps: anterior commissure–
posterior commissure (AC–PC) correction, intensity inhomogeneity cor-
rection, brain extraction, cerebellum removal, tissues segmentation,
registration to a 93-ROI template (Kabani et al., 1998) and ROI labels
projection. For each ROI, we finally use the gray matter tissue volume
normalized with the intracranial volume as the feature representation.
For PET data, the PET images are aligned to their corresponding T1 MR
images with affine registration, then the average PET intensity value of
each ROI is computed as the feature representation. Based on the 93-
ROI template, we extract a 93-dimensional ROI-based feature vector
from the specific modality (i.e., MRI or PET).

𝐗(𝑣)
𝑡∈R𝑛𝑡×𝑑𝑣represents the feature matrix of 𝑣th modality at 𝑡th visit,

Since our study is based on MRI, PET and demographics, we denote
them respectively as (1),(2)and(3), where (1)and(2)are longi-
tudinal data containing MRI and PET records from 𝑇historical visits,
respectively. (3)∈R𝑁×𝑑3is complete and only contains baseline data.
Although (3)is composed of mostly static biomarkers, features such

diagnosis, which contribute to the comprehensive characterization of
AD individuals (Kanekiyo and Bu, 2016; Kim et al., 2020; Williams

Note that we are focusing on processing variable-length longitudinal

3.2. Problem definition
Fig. 1 illustrates the problem considered in this paper, with the blue
part representing the training set and the green part representing the
testing set. We train our model with the blue part and predict the green
target scores marked with ‘‘?’’ based on green history input. Each row
represents one individual, each column represents one time point, and
each layer represents one data source. The block in the 𝑖th row and
the𝑡th column of the 𝑣-th layer represents the feature vector of 𝑣th
modality of individual 𝑖at𝑡th time point, which is denoted as 𝐱(𝑣)
𝑖,𝑡. For
each modality in Fig. 1, the number of blocks (including white ones
marked with ‘‘?’’) in column 𝑡in one layer indicates the number of
available individuals 𝑛𝑡at time point 𝑡.
As can be seen from Fig. 1, we focus on modeling AD progres-
sion based on the longitudinal multi-modal data that contains missing
records at some time points. Furthermore, in practical situations, the
number of visits varies in individuals, for which we focus on processing
variable-length data and making predictions on the score trajectories
over an arbitrary period of time, which provides more flexibility in
practical applications.

3.3. Proposed model
To address the above challenge, we propose a unified DPM frame-
work composed of the deep multi-modality fusion module and the
RNN-based sequence learning module, as illustrated in Fig. 2.
3.3.1. Model overview
The deep multi-modality fusion module learns latent representa-
tions on each historical visit based on longitudinal multi-modal data.
During this process, the degradation networks ( Zhang et al. , 2019 ) in
the fusion module will explore the complementary information between
different modalities, and latent representations are learned based on the
observed modalities.
After that, we concatenate the longitudinal latent representations
with cognitive scores on corresponding visits and feed the concatenated
vectors into RNN for sequence learning. The missing part will be
replaced by estimated values from the dense layer (also known as the
fully connected layer) based on the hidden state on the previous visit.Since RNN encodes the underlying temporal characteristic of each
individual, when predicting future scores, the estimated values at the
previous visit will be used as input despite that there is no available
longitudinal input at future time points.
We employ the collaborative training strategy for the multi-modality
fusion module and the sequence learning module to learn task-oriented
representations and optimal parameters.
3.3.2. Deep multi-modality fusion module
For each time point 𝑡, we combine MRI, PET, and demographics at
the current visit to learn the latent representation matrix 𝐇𝑡∈R𝑛𝑡×𝑑ℎ,
where𝑑ℎdenotes the size of latent representations. 𝐇𝑡comprehen-
sively characterizes AD individuals and contributes to AD progression
modeling.
Conventional multi-modal methods learn modality-shared represen-
tations by mapping multi-modal data into a common space and require
a certain degree of similarity between the learned representation and
each original modality. Different from traditional methods, considering
that different modalities depict the sample individual from different

aspects, we explore the complementary information between different
modalities and regard the desired representation as the comprehensive
characterization of individuals. Concretely, we focus on finding the
complete representation that contains information from all original
modalities. To this end, we construct the degradation functions for each
modality and require the learned representation to reconstruct original
modal data through degradation functions. In this way, we ensure
the representation to encode complete information from all observed
modalities.
Concretely, in this paper, we construct the deep multi-modality
fusion module based on degradation networks, as shown in Fig. 3. The
degradation layer for each modality comprises several dense layers. To
reduce parameter numbers and avoid network overfitting, the same
modality among different visits are passed through the same degra-
dation layer. On each visit, the latent representations will be passed
through degradation layers to reconstruct original modalities.
For partial-modality-missing cases, the learned representation will
be required to reconstruct the available modalities to guarantee the
sufficiency in utilizing multi-modal data. Note that for each individual,
those visit-missing time points will also take part in the fusion process
and their corresponding representations can be obtained based on
complete𝐱(3)
𝑡(i.e. demographics). However, from our perspective, these
representations lack temporal information and may interfere with the
sequence learning, for which we still regard these visits as missing visits
in the following sequence learning module.
To reconstruct the corresponding modality via the 𝑣-th degradation
network using the latent representation, we design the loss function 𝑣
for the𝑣-th degradation network as following Eq. (1):
𝑣=𝑁∑
𝑖=1𝑇∑
𝑡=1‖‖‖‖𝑜(𝑣)
𝑖,𝑡(
𝑓𝑣(𝐡𝑖,𝑡;Θ𝑣)−𝐱(𝑣)
𝑖,𝑡)‖‖‖‖2
2(1)
where𝑓𝑣(⋅;Θ𝑣)is the degradation layer for the 𝑣th modality with
parameters Θ𝑣including multiple dense layers, 𝐱(𝑣)
𝑖,𝑡denotes the 𝑣-th
modality data of 𝑖-th individual at the 𝑡-th time point, and 𝑜(𝑣)
𝑖,𝑡indicates
the missing data; if the 𝑖th individual has data in the 𝑣th modality on
𝑡th visit,𝑜(𝑣)
𝑖,𝑡= 1, otherwise 𝑜(𝑣)
𝑖,𝑡= 0.
Note that the multi-modality fusion module includes 𝑉degradation
networks, we develop the reconstruction loss 𝑟𝑒𝑐as follows:

3.3.3. RNN based sequence learning module
Based on the learned longitudinal representation, we encode and
capture the temporal correlations of these representations with RNN-
based sequence learning module. In this paper, we employ long short-
term memory (LSTM) network ( Gers et al. , 2000 ) as the basic RNN
Fig. 4. Illustration of sequence learning module, where ̂𝐬𝑡,𝐜𝑡,𝐳𝑡, represent the input,
the cell state and the hidden state at 𝑡-th visit, respectively.
model for sequence learning. Note that LSTM is not the only choice
in our framework, it can be replaced by any other RNN models such as
gated recurrent unit (GRU) ( Cho et al. , 2014 ) and minimal gated unit
(MGU) ( Zhou et al. , 2016 ).
(a) Long short-term memory network
The structure of LSTM is shown in Fig. 4 and update formulations
of LSTM are as follows:
𝐟𝑡=𝜎([𝐳𝑡−1,̂𝐬𝑡]𝐖𝑓+𝐛𝑓)(3)
𝐢𝑡=𝜎([𝐳𝑡−1,̂𝐬𝑡]𝐖𝑖+𝐛𝑖)(4)
𝐨𝑡=𝜎([𝐳𝑡−1,̂𝐬𝑡]𝐖𝑜+𝐛𝑜)(5)
̃𝐜𝑡= tanh([𝐳𝑡−1,̂𝐬𝑡]𝐖𝑐+𝐛𝑐)(6)
𝐜𝑡=𝐟𝑡⊙𝐜𝑡−1+𝐢𝑡⊙̃𝐜𝑡 (7)
𝐳𝑡=𝐨𝑡⊙tanh(𝐜𝑡)(8)
wherê𝐬𝑡,𝐜𝑡,̃𝐜𝑡, and𝐳𝑡represent the current input, the cell state, the
candidate state, and the hidden state at the 𝑡th visit, respectively.
{𝐖𝑓,𝐖𝑖,𝐖𝑜,𝐖𝑐,𝐛𝑓,𝐛𝑖,𝐛𝑜,𝐛𝑐}are network parameters. ⊙denotes the
dot product operator, tanh( ⋅)denotes the hyperbolic tangent function,
and𝜎(⋅)denotes the sigmoid activation function. On each visit 𝑡, the
current input 𝐬𝑡, the cell state 𝐜𝑡−1and the hidden state 𝐳𝑡−1of the
previous visit are simultaneously fed into LSTM to update 𝐜𝑡and𝐳𝑡.
The hidden state 𝐳𝑡−1can be interpreted as fusing history information
of all past visits up to the current visit, for which 𝐳𝑡−1is used to predict
the input𝐬𝑡.
For different time points, LSTM always processes data with the same
parameters. In other words, each time point will be processed by the
same LSTM unit regardless of the sequence length of input data, for
which LSTM can process variable-length input.
(b) Processing longitudinal data with sequence learning module
Next, we are going to explicate how to process longitudinal data
with the sequence learning module. Assuming that the longitudinal
latent representations have been obtained from the multi-modality
fusion module, we take the 𝑖th individual for example and denote its
longitudinal latent representations as {𝐡1,𝐡2,…,𝐡𝑇}.3
As can be seen from Fig. 2, for each visit 𝑡, we concatenate the
hidden representations 𝐡𝑡and cognitive score vector 𝐲𝑡as the longi-
tudinal input 𝐬𝑡, i.e.,𝐬𝑡=[𝐡𝑡,𝐲𝑡]∈R𝑑ℎ+𝑑𝑦. To address the data missing
issue (i.e., visit missing or score missing or both) in 𝐬𝑡, we utilize the
‘‘Model Filling’’ method, imputing 𝐬𝑡with predicted input ̃𝐬𝑡from the

paper unless explicitly required.

dense layer based on the hidden state 𝐳𝑡−1. To be specific, we first feed
𝐳𝑡−1into the dense layer to predict ̃𝐬𝑡:
̃𝐬𝑡=𝐳𝑡−1𝐖𝑑+𝐬𝑡−1 (9)
where𝐖𝑑denotes the weight parameter of the dense layer. Note that
the estimated value ̃𝐬𝑡is dependent on the hidden state 𝐳𝑡−1, which is
not available at the first time point. If data are missing at the first
time point, the mean value across all time points of all the training
individuals will be used for imputation.
Based on the estimated value ̃𝐬𝑡, we perform element-wise imputa-
tion on𝐬𝑡in the imputation layer:
̂𝐬𝑡=𝜹𝒕⊙𝐬𝑡+ (1 −𝜹𝒕)⊙̃𝐬𝑡 (10)
where𝜹𝒕∈R𝑑ℎ+𝑑𝑦is a masking vector that indicates missing values in
𝐬𝑡, which is defined as follows:
𝛿𝑡,𝑑={
1, 𝑠𝑡,𝑑is complete
0, 𝑠𝑡,𝑑is missing(11)
where𝛿𝑡,𝑑and𝑠𝑡,𝑑denote the𝑑-th component in 𝜹𝒕and𝐬𝑡, respectively.
The structure of the imputation module is shown in Fig. 5.
Finally, we feed the imputed data ̃𝐬𝑡, cell state𝐜𝑡−1, and hidden state
𝐳𝑡−1into the LSTM unit to update the current states 𝐜𝑡and𝐳𝑡.
During the longitudinal data processing stage, we minimize the
fitting loss 𝑓𝑖𝑡as follows:
𝑓𝑖𝑡=𝑁∑
𝑖=1𝑇−1∑
𝑡=1|||𝐩𝑖,𝑡⊙(𝑔(𝐬𝑖,𝑡;Ω)−𝐬𝑖,𝑡+1)|||(12)
where|⋅|denotes the sum of absolute values of entries, 𝐬𝑖,𝑡∈R1×(𝑑ℎ+𝑑𝑦)
denotes the input vector of individual 𝑖at the𝑡th time point and 𝑔(⋅;Ω)
denotes the network including the imputation layer, the sequence
learning module, and the dense layer with the parameters Ω.𝐩𝑖,𝑡is an
indicator vector with 𝑝(𝑖,𝑗),𝑡= 1if the𝑗-th feature of the 𝑖-th individual
is available at 𝑡-th time point and 𝑝(𝑖,𝑗),𝑡= 0otherwise.
(c) Modeling future AD progression with sequence learning module
Finally, we elaborate on how to predict the cognitive scores at target
time points, as shown in Fig. 2. Likewise, we take the 𝑖th individual
for example, when it comes to future progression modeling, there is
no longer available longitudinal input from the (𝑇+ 1)-th time point
onward. Since LSTM encodes the underlying temporal characteristic
of individuals, the estimated value based on the hidden state at the
previous time point is directly fed into LSTM for prediction. Recall that
̃𝐬𝑡=[̃𝐡𝑡,̃𝐲𝑡], hence the predicted scores ̃𝐲𝑇+1can be easily obtained by
taking the last 𝑑𝑦dimensions of ̃𝐬𝑇+1through the slice layer. The same
procedure is adopted to subsequent time points.
The prediction error 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 for the sequence learning module is
defined as follows:
𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟=𝑁∑
𝑖=1𝑇+𝐹∑
𝑡=𝑇+1|𝐪𝑖,𝑡⊙((̃𝐬𝑖,𝑡) −𝐲𝑖,𝑡)| (13)where (⋅)denotes the slice operator of on ̃𝐬𝑖,𝑡.𝐪𝑖,𝑡is an indicator matrix
with𝑞(𝑖,𝑗),𝑡= 1if the𝑗-th score of the 𝑖-th individual is available at the
𝑡-th time point, and 𝑝(𝑖,𝑗),𝑡= 0otherwise.
3.3.4. Collaborative model learning
The most straightforward way to address the DPM problem is to
separately train the above two modules by first preprocessing the
multi-modal data with the multi-modality fusion module based on the
objection function 𝑟𝑒𝑐, and then feeding the learned representation
into sequence learning module for AD progression modeling based on
𝑓𝑖𝑡and𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟. In contrast to this two-step processing manner, we
assume that the collaborative training of these two modules will facil-
itate learning the task-oriented representation and promote parameter
learning. In other words, the classification results of LSTM will be fed
back to the fusion module, making the learned representations better fit
for specific prediction tasks, and the optimal representations will assist
the network in learning optimal parameters.
Therefore, we combine two modules and train the unified frame-
work with the following composite objective function:
=𝛼1𝑟𝑒𝑐+𝛼2𝑓𝑖𝑡+𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟
=𝛼1𝑉∑

𝑖=1𝑇+𝐹∑
𝑡=𝑇+1|𝐪𝑖,𝑡⊙((̃𝐬𝑖,𝑡)−𝐲𝑖,𝑡)|(14)
where𝛼1,𝛼2are hyperparameters. It is important to emphasize that
this loss function is only calculated on the observed values of the
original data, missing data is not taken into account when computing
the loss. We will verify in the following experiment that this organic
combination does contribute to better results.
3.3.5. Testing scenario
Suppose that we obtain a trained model, for given individuals, we
aim to predict their score trajectories at 𝐾target time points. If it is the
first visit of the individuals, we assume that they have the complete
baseline multi-modal data ({𝐱(1)
1,𝐱(2)
1,…,𝐱(𝑉)
1},𝐲1), then the baseline
multi-modal data {𝐱(1)
1,𝐱(2)
1,…,𝐱(𝑉)
1}is first fed into the multi-modality
fusion module to obtain a baseline latent representation 𝐡1. Then𝐡1is
concatenated with the baseline scores 𝐲1as baseline input 𝐬1and fed
into LSTM for sequence learning. Next, LSTM will process 𝐬1and update
the current state 𝐳1.𝐳1will be passed through the dense layer to predict
input̃𝐬2. Since the individuals only have baseline data, the estimated
input̃𝐬2will be directly used as the LSTM input of the next time point
to update𝐳2and predict ̃𝐬3. The whole sequence learning process will
be repeated until ̃𝐬𝐾+1is obtained. Finally, {̃𝐬2,̃𝐬3,…,̃𝐬𝐾+1}are fed into
the slice layer to obtain the predicted scores {̃𝐲2,̃𝐲3,…,̃𝐲𝐾+1}.
Likewise, when individuals have multiple historical visits, we first
feed the longitudinal multi-modal data into the multi-modality fusion
module to learn longitudinal representations. However, in fusion mod-
ule, those visits that contain neither the MRI record nor the PET record
will be marked as missing visits in the sequence learning module. In the
sequence learning module, the missing values will be imputed with the
estimated values from the previous visit. Then the sequence learning
module employs the same procedure as baseline individuals to predict
the target score trajectories.
4. Experiment
4.1. Experiment settings
In the experiment, we predict the progression of given individuals
by predicting their clinical scores (MMSE, ADAS-Cog, CDR-Global, and
CDR-SOB) at up to 15 target time points (with a six-month interval
between consecutive time points). To verify the performance of the
proposed method, we compare it with one multi-task learning method,

three state-of-the-art RNN-based methods, and the variants of three
benchmark models with respect to different missing-imputation strate-
gies. Furthermore, we conduct several ablation experiments to verify
the hypotheses employed in our method: the effectiveness of utilizing
multi-modal data, the effectiveness of the multi-modality fusion mod-
ule, and the effectiveness of the collaborative training strategy. The
source code used in this paper can be found at https://github.com/
solerxl/Code_For_MIA_2022.
In the following section, we successively elaborate on data pre-
processing steps, performance metrics, comparison methods, regression
results, and further analysis in our experiments.
4.1.1. Data preprocessing
1.Interval alignment : There are two kinds of intervals in the original
dataset, i.e. 6-month and 12-month. Since RNN requires data
with a fixed time interval, we first unify the time interval to
6-month for model learning and use demographics for multi-
modality fusion for the additional visits where no MRI and PET
data are available (i.e. M30, M42, M54, M66, M78, M90).
2.Age processing : As in practical situations, the age of the individ-
uals will grow over time. To this end, we first regard the age in
the original demographics as baseline age and increase the age
at subsequent visits based on the duration from the baseline. For
example, if a individual is 65 years old at baseline, then the age
will be 65.5 at M06.
3.Generating target time points : Here we elaborate on how to gen-
erate historical visits and target time points from the original
longitudinal data. The whole generation process is shown in
Fig. 6. Recall that our model is able to predict the score tra-
jectory of arbitrary length. To reflect such a scenario, for each
individual, we regard the last available time point for imaging
data (MRI/PET) as the end of historical visits and the subsequent
time points as the target time points to be predicted (Individual 1
in Fig. 6). In this way, some individuals will contain no clinical
scores at target time points (Individual 2 and 3 in Fig. 6). To
maximize data utilization, we remove those individuals that do
not contain any score data after baseline (Individual 2 in Fig. 6).
For the remaining individuals, we predict the last time point
containing clinical scores and treat the previous time points as
historical visits (Individual 3 in Fig. 6). Finally, we obtain a
dataset of 773 individuals, of which the length of target time
points ranges from 1 to 15. The distributions of the length of
historical visits and target time points of the obtained dataset
are shown in Fig. 7.
Fig. 7. Distribution of the length of historical visits and the length of target time
points.
4.1.2. Evaluation metrics
We evaluate the prediction performance of the model with mean
absolute error (MAE) (Mehdipour-Ghazi et al., 2019) and weighted cor-
relation coefficient (wR) (Duchesne et al., 2009; Ito et al., 2011; Ston-
nington et al., 2010), which are wildly used in DPM-related literature.
The two metrics are defined as
MAE(𝑘) =𝐹∑
𝑡=11
𝑚𝑘,𝑡𝐹|||𝐘(∶,𝑘),𝑡−̃𝐘(∶,𝑘),𝑡|||(15)
wR(𝑘) =∑𝐹
𝑡=1Corr(𝐘(∶,𝑘),𝑡,̃𝐘(∶,𝑘),𝑡)𝑚𝑘,𝑡
∑𝐹
𝑡=1𝑚𝑘,𝑡(16)
For a certain score type 𝑘(e.g. MMSE/CDR-Global/CDR-SOB/ADAS-
Cog),𝐘(∶,𝑘),𝑡and̃𝐘(∶,𝑘),𝑡denote the corresponding ground truth score
vector and predicted score vector of all observed individuals at 𝑡th
time point. 𝑚𝑘,𝑡denotes the number of observed individuals for score
type𝑘at𝑡-th time point. Corr(𝐲,̃𝐲)represents the correlation coefficient
between the ground truth 𝐲and the predicted scores ̃𝐲, which is
calculated as:
Corr(𝐲,̃𝐲) =∑
𝑖(𝑦𝑖−̄ 𝑦)(̃ 𝑦𝑖−̄̃ 𝑦)
√∑
𝑖(𝑦𝑖−̄ 𝑦)2√∑
𝑖(̃ 𝑦𝑖−̄̃ 𝑦)2(17)
where𝑦𝑖and̃ 𝑦𝑖represent the 𝑖-th element of 𝐲and̃𝐲,̄ 𝑦and̄̃ 𝑦represent
the mean value of 𝐲and̃𝐲.
For MAE, the lower value indicates the better performance. In
contrast, the higher wR indicates the better performance. It is important
to note that the above metrics only measure the prediction results on
the complete data. In the experiments, we use a 10-fold cross-validation
strategy with 10 repetitions to evaluate the average performance of
different methods. To determine the optimal hyperparameters for the
model, in each fold, we further partition the training data into two
non-overlapping subsets using an 8:2 ratio, with one subset used for
model training and the other used for model evaluation. The optimal
hyperparameters are selected based on the minimum MAE value on
predicting MMSE. After determining the optimal hyperparameters, we
train the model on the whole training set and report the prediction
results on the testing set.
Moreover, to check the statistical significance of our method, we
performed the 𝑡-test based on the results in terms of MAE and wR on
four cognitive scores at the 95% confidence level (Dietterich, 1998).
4.2. Competing methods
First of all, we compare our model with three benchmark mod-
els: support vector regression(SVR), Lasso, and GRU. We design their
variants according to different missing filling strategies. Taking the
𝑖th individual as an example, assuming that its 𝑗th feature of the
𝑣th modality at the 𝑡th visit (i.e., 𝑥(𝑣)
(𝑖,𝑗),𝑡) is missing, we consider the
following missing imputation strategies:

1.Mean Filling : The mean value of the corresponding feature of 𝐱𝑖
at other observed visits is utilized to impute the missing data:

,|||𝑡(𝑣)
𝑖,𝑗|||denotes the cardinality of 𝑡(𝑣)
𝑖,𝑗. If
|||𝑡(𝑣)
𝑖,𝑗|||= 0, then value 0is used for imputation.
2.Forward Filling : The corresponding feature at the previous ob-
served visit of 𝐱𝑖is used for imputation, that is:
𝑥(𝑣)
(𝑖,𝑗),𝑡=𝑥(𝑣)
(𝑖,𝑗),𝑡−1(19)
If there is no observed data before current visit 𝑡, value 0is used
for imputation
3.Linear Filling : In the ‘‘Linear Filling’’ strategy, a linear function
is established based on the corresponding features of the two
closest observed visits before and after the current visit. The
corresponding imputation value is calculated by substituting the
current visit into the established linear function. Assuming that
the closest forward observed visit is 𝑡1and the closest backward
observed visit is 𝑡2, it is easy to establish the linear function for
𝑥(𝑣)
(𝑖,𝑗),𝑡as follows:
𝑥(𝑣)
(𝑖,𝑗),𝑡=𝑥(𝑣)
(𝑖,𝑗),𝑡2−𝑥(𝑣)
(𝑖,𝑗),𝑡1
𝑡2−𝑡1(𝑡−𝑡1)+𝑥(𝑣)
(𝑖,𝑗),𝑡1(20)
4.Model Filling : As we mentioned before, for RNN models, the
estimated value calculated on the previous visit can be used to
impute the missing data on the current visit.
We denote ‘‘Mean Filling’’ strategy as MeanF, ‘‘Forward Filling’’
strategy as FF, ‘‘Linear Filling’’ strategy as LF, and ‘‘Model Filling’’ strat-
egy as ModelF to design variants for SVR, Lasso, and GRU, that is, SVR-
MeanF, SVR-LF, SVR-FF, Lasso-MeanF, Lasso-LF, Lasso-FF, GRU-MeanF,
GRU-LF, GRU-FF, and GRU-ModelF.
Moreover, we compare our method with the following DPM meth-
ods:
•Convex Fused Sparse Group Lasso (cFSGL)4(Zhou et al. , 2013 )
is a multi-task learning method for the DPM problem. It simul-
taneously selects task-shared and task-specific features using the
sparse group Lasso penalty. This method introduces the indicator
matrix to deal with missing data.

Fig. 8. Illustration of how SVR/Lasso predict score 𝑘with variable-length data, where
15×7 = 105 models (15 time points, 7 groups) are constructed for predicting score 𝑘at
different time points of different groups. The prediction results at different time points
of different groups will be ultimately concatenated for metrics calculation.
•Peephole LSTM (LSTM-P)5(Mehdipour-Ghazi et al. , 2019 ) is
an LSTM-based method that tackles the missing issue by adding
peephole connections to the LSTM network.
•MinimalRNN6(Nguyen et al. , 2020 ) is a MinimalRNN-based
method that utilizes ‘‘Model Filling’’ strategy to impute missing
data with MinimalRNN for AD progression modeling.
•Temporal LSTM (LSTM-T)7(Jung et al. , 2021 ) is an LSTM-based
method that considers the temporal correlation between different
time points and utilizes the ‘‘Model Filling’’ strategy based on
LSTM.
4.3. Group training strategy for SVR and Lasso
Since SVR and Lasso can only process individuals with fixed-length
input, we divide the dataset into seven groups according to their se-
quence length. Individuals in the sample group have the same sequence
length.
For each group, we concatenate the multi-modal longitudinal data
in the order of ‘‘modalities first, sequences follow’’. We construct
different SVR and Lasso models for predicting each score type 𝑘at
each time point 𝑡based on each group 𝑙, which consequently leads
to a total of 4 × 7 × 15 = 420 (4 score types, 7 groups, and up to
15 target time points) models for SVR and Lasso, respectively. Fig. 8
illustrates how SVR/Lasso models AD progression with variable-length
longitudinal data.

For a certain group 𝑙, in the training phase, we construct 4 models
for predicting score 𝑘with each model corresponding to one target time
point, and then we input features and scores for model learning. In the
testing phase, we feed the testing data into four models to obtain the
testing output. We further concatenate the testing output of each group
to get the final predicted score matrix ̃𝐘(∶,𝑘), which will be compared
with𝐘(∶,𝑘)in metrics calculation.
4.4. Experimental results
In this paper, we use two dense layers to construct the degrada-
tion layer in our network. The ‘‘ReLU’’ was used as the activation
function. For GRU-ModelF, LSTM-P, LSTM-T, and MinimalRNN, we
employ𝛼2𝑓𝑖𝑡+𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟as the objective function. For other GRU variants,
we employ 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟as the objective function. All network parameters
of deep learning methods are randomly initialized before training. To
select optimal hyperparameters, we further divide the training data and
use 80% for training and 20% for validating. To simplify the tuning
process for deep learning methods, we set the dimension of all hidden
parameters (i.e., degradation layer parameters, dense layer parameters,
and the states in LSTM) as 𝑑ℎ, which is the dimension of the latent
representation. The Hyperopt toolbox (Bergstra et al., 2013) is utilized
to find the best hyperparameter combinations by minimizing the MAE
value on the validation set, and the hyperparameter search space for
different methods are presented in Table 4.
Table 5 exhibits the performance of all methods in predicting four
cognitive scores in terms of MAE and wR. The bold font represents
the best result and (∗)indicates that the performance of the competing
method is significantly different from ours. It can be seen that our
algorithm performs significantly better than all other methods in most
cases.
Furthermore, in Figs. 9 and 10, we illustrate the specific perfor-
mance of all methods at each single time point, from which we can
see that our algorithm maintains a stable and competitive performance
at most time points. It is noteworthy that, in Fig. 10, all methods havevery low wR at the last three time points. In particular, there are even
no wR results at the last time point. The reason is that the available
data at the last three time points are extremely limited, and we only
calculate wR on the observed data, which results in very low wR values.
In addition, there is only one individual available at the 15th time point
(which can be seen from Fig. 7) and the wR value cannot be calculated,
for which no wR results at this time point are presented.
4.5. Further analysis
In this part, we conduct three ablation experiments to verify the
hypothesis employed in our method, that is, the effectiveness of uti-
lizing multi-modal data, the effectiveness of the multi-modality fusion
module, and the effectiveness of the collaborative training strategy.
Furthermore, we also explore the importance of different modalities
and apply our method to predict the progression of modalities.
4.5.1. Effect of multi-modal data
In this experiment, we train and test our framework with the single-
modal data to validate the effectiveness of combining multi-modal
data. First, considering the ‘‘partial-modality-missing’’ and the ‘‘visit-
missing’’ issues in the dataset, we discard those individuals containing
no MRI or no PET data at historical visits and finally obtain a subset
of 384 individuals. Then we train and test our model with the single-
modal and multi-modal data of the selected individuals, respectively,
and compare their results in Table 6. We can find that multi-modal
data exhibits the most competitive performance in Table 6, which
suggests that the combination of multi-modal data contributes to the
prediction of AD score trajectories. Besides, we also notice that PET
modality performs better in the single-modality case than MRI and
demographics.
4.5.2. Effect of multi-modality fusion
To verify the efficacy of the fusion module, we remove the multi-
modality fusion module from the proposed framework and train the

based on the objective function 𝛼2𝑓𝑖𝑡+𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟. The results are exhibited
in Table 7, from which we can see that the proposed framework with
multi-modality fusion significantly outperforms concatenating modali-
ties.
4.5.3. Effect of collaborative training
The collaborative training of the multi-modality fusion module
and sequence learning module contributes to model learning. In this
experiment, we compare this collaborative training manner with the
separate training manner that the longitudinal multi-modal data arefirst used to train multi-modality fusion module based on the ob-
jection function 𝑟𝑒𝑐, then the module output (i.e., the longitudinal
latent representations) are utilized for training the sequence learning
module based on the objection function 𝛼2𝑓𝑖𝑡+𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟. The results
are shown in Table 8. It is evident that the collaboratively training
manner outperforms the separate training manner. Moreover, note that
in Section 4.5.2 we present the learning performance of concatenating
modalities, the separate training manner is even worse than concatenat-
ing modalities despite the utilization of multi-modality fusion module,
which indicates that if the fusion module and the prediction module
are not trained collaboratively, the representation learned by the fusion

module may even disturb the model learning rather than enhance the
model performance.
4.5.4. Importance of different modalities
In this part, we explore the importance of each modality by succes-
sively removing one of the modalities and modeling AD progression
with the other two modalities. We analyze the importance of each
modality by comparing the corresponding decrease in the model per-
formance when a certain modality is discarded. Considering that some
individuals do not have any MRI or PET data at historical visits, we em-
ploy the selection rule in Section 4.5.1, and compare the performance
of different strategies based on the subset of 384 selected individuals.
As shown in Table 9, the most obvious change occurs in drop-
ping demographics, which exhibits even better performance than the
complete modalities in some cases. The possible reason is that the de-
mographics are not sample-specific data for predicting AD progression,
and it may be somewhat redundant to the proposed model. In contrast,
the performance decreases in both dropping MRI and PET, indicating
the importance of imaging modalities.
4.5.5. Predicting modality progression
It is noteworthy that our model can predict the progression of both
clinical scores and modalities. Specifically, when predicting the score
trajectories, the estimated variable ̃𝐬𝑡contains not only the clinical
scores̃𝐲𝑡, but also the comprehensive representation ̃𝐡𝑡at the target
time point. As shown in Fig. 3, with the estimated representation ̃𝐡𝑡,
the multi-modal data at the target time points can be reconstructed by
the degradation networks. In this experiment, we apply the proposed
framework to predict the progression of MRI and PET.
We use the first half of the historical visits of each individual to
predict his/her MRI and PET at the second half of the historical visits.
Since GRU-ModelF, LSTM-T, and MinimalRNN are directly fed with
the concatenated multi-modal data, the corresponding values of MRI
and PET at target time points can be directly estimated by the ‘‘Model
Filling’’ strategy. Therefore, we compare with the above methods and
use MAE as the measure to evaluate the prediction results. Table 10
shows the MAE results in our experiments. From the table, one may
observe that our method achieved the best performance in predicting
the modality progression.5. Discussion
In practice, disease progression modeling suffers from both issues
of label missing and modality missing. The convex Fused Sparse Group
Lasso (cFSGL) model (Zhou et al., 2013) is the first work to deal
with the label missing issue in the training process for disease pro-
gression modeling, which ingeniously formulates disease progression
prediction as a multi-task learning problem. However, it does not
consider the possible modality missing issue in the longitudinal learn-
ing. To obtain a complete solution, Zhang et al. propose a novel
two-stage Multi-Resemblance Multi-Target Low-Rank Coding (MMLC)
framework (Zhang et al., 2021) to simultaneously handle both label
missing and modality missing issues. Specifically, in the first stage,
the MMLC innovatively presents an online multi-resemblant low-rank
sparse coding method to immune to incomplete longitudinal modality
data and maintain a low computational cost. In the second stage, the
MMLC employs a simple yet effective multi-target learning method to
address the label missing issue, which can actually be recognized as an
ablated version of the cFSGL model.
Similar to the MMLC model, our proposed framework considers
the hybrid data-missing issue on both input and output sides. In our
method, an indicator matrix is used to handle the label missing issue.
Besides, our framework further imputes missing target scores during the
training process. Specifically, the missing values in 𝐲𝑡can be imputed
with the corresponding entries in ̃𝐬𝑡via the imputation module. To
handle the modality missing issue, both cases of ‘‘partial-modality-
missing’’ and ‘‘visit-missing’’ are fully considered in our framework.
The proposed multi-modality fusion module can handle the ‘‘partial-
modality-missing’’ issue and exploit the complementary information
from the remaining available modalities. Regarding the ‘‘visit-missing’’
issue, since the complementary information is quite limited at these
time points, we propose to utilize the ‘‘Model Filling’’ strategy to predict
the comprehensive representations at these time points.
Although our method exhibits superior performance compared with
other methods, it is subject to two limitations. First, we only explored
the modality importance in Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.4, whereas the
importance of different features (brain regions) may be of more interest
to clinicians, which has not yet been considered in our current model.
Second, our method uses multi-modal hand-crafted features, which may
not be well coordinated with prediction models and therefore degrades
the prediction performance. Recently, deep learning methods have been
proposed to automatically learn feature representations from medical
images in an end-to-end manner. One of the representative works is
wiseDNN (Liu et al., 2020), which is a weakly supervised densely
connected neural network for task-oriented feature extraction and joint
progression prediction. However, wiseDNN uses only complete baseline
MRI scans, ignoring the temporal changes of imaging features without
considering the data missing issue. To address these problems, the
longitudinal-diagnostic generative adversarial network (LDGAN) (Ning
et al., 2020) is proposed for joint longitudinal image synthesis and
clinical score prediction based on incomplete MRIs and incomplete clin-
ical scores. A major concern of existing end-to-end weakly supervised
(i.e., visit missing or score missing or both) methods is that they only fo-
cus on single-modal data. However, for multi-modal data, the inherent

inter-modality correlation and the large data size will inevitably bring
new challenges to both data utilization and computational cost. The
comprehensive representation learning strategy in our method provides
a feasible solution for utilizing multi-modal data in DPM models. In our
future work, we will develop effective DPM methods with incomplete
longitudinal multi-modal data using an end-to-end manner.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a deep latent representation collaborated
sequence learning framework for AD progression modeling based on
incomplete variable-length longitudinal multi-modal data. The multi-
modality fusion module is first introduced to learn comprehensive
representations at each time point based on multi-modal data (even
individuals with incomplete modalities). Then RNN based sequence
learning module is used to flexibly process variable-length input and
predict longitudinal trajectories of cognitive scores. We utilized the
‘‘Model Filling’’ strategy to handle the visit missing issue and trained
the fusion module and sequence learning module collaboratively in
a unified framework, so as to facilitate both representation learning
and parameter learning. The experimental results on the ADNI dataset
verified the superiority of the proposed model.
